## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern, separating concerns into three main layers. Code is organized by feature in the `lib/` directory for better maintainability.

```

- **Data Layer:** Handles API calls, database interactions, and data models.
- **Domain Layer:** Contains business logic, entities, and repository interfaces.
- **Presentation Layer:** Manages UI components, state management with Riverpod, and routing.

## 📝 Key Guidelines

### Architecture

This project adheres to **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring separation of concerns and testability. It uses **Riverpod** for state management, promoting a clear distinction between business logic and UI. Features are organized into independent modules, each following the layered architecture (Data, Domain, Presentation).

### Code Style

We follow the official [Effective Dart: Style](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) guide. Key conventions:
- Use `PascalCase` for types (classes, enums).
- Use `camelCase` for variables, methods, and parameters.
- Use `snake_case` for file and directory names.
- Keep lines under 80 characters; use trailing commas for multi-parameter functions.
- Prefer const constructors for immutable widgets.

### Testing

The project employs a comprehensive testing strategy:
- **Unit Tests:** Cover individual functions, methods, and classes in the data and domain layers (located in `test/unit_test/`).
- **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between components (in `test/integration_test/`).
- **Widget Tests:** Test UI components for correct rendering and behavior.

Run tests with `flutter test`. Aim for high coverage, especially in domain and data layers.

### Error Handling

- Use `Either<Failure, Success>` from Dartz for functional error handling.
- Implement custom `Failure` classes for domain-specific errors.
- Display errors in UI using `SelectableText.rich` with red color for visibility.
- Handle loading and error states within Riverpod providers.

### Performance Optimization

- Use const widgets where possible.
- Implement efficient list rendering with `ListView.builder`.
- Optimize Firebase queries with indexes and limits.
- Cache network resources appropriately.
